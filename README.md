Visualizes:
- Continuous 360Â° listener motion around stationary source
- Dynamic left/right channel balance based on angular position
- Environmental reverberation effects from scene geometry

Demonstrates:
- Doppler effect during source rotation
- HRTF-based spatialization for different azimuth angles
- Energy decay from acoustic occlusion/reflections
